  b. Are there any comments? What do they do?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  
  The first two lines of the sample program are comments. A comment's purpose include:
  - Describing what is happening in the code - why did we choose to write this code?
  - Providing important information about the code such as the author or its purpose.

  c. What is indented and why?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  
  The code inside the main function is indented. It is indented because there are curly brackets around it. The rule for indentation is

```
(pairs of curly brackets around the code) x 4 spaces = indentation amount
```
