Hello everyone! 

On this page, you will find tutorial notes and examples from class. The notes will be uploaded after the tutorial so you can access them in the lab so keep an eye on this space. Underneath this paragraph is a copy of the class email I sent out at the beginning of the term if you ever need to recall the important information.

My name is Clarissa and I will be your tutor, and Shrey is your lab assistant! Our emails are in the contents of the email but if you ever forget, navigate to the *Timetable* page on WebCMS3 and scroll to the bottom where you will see links to our WebCMS3 profiles which have our emails.

Here is some important information!
- Everything you need to know about the course (course outline, lecture notes, tutorial notes, etc) can be found on the **WebCMS3 page** and to access that page follow this link: https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1511/20T3/
- On **Moodle**, you will be able to find links to lecture recordings and our tutorials on Blackboard Collaborate!
- Our tutorials will be held on Blackboard Collaborate which you can access from the Moodle page. They will start *3pm Friday* every week but Week 6.
1. Click on the link *Blackboard Collaborate - Tutorials and Labs*. 
2. Navigate to the second page of classes.
3. Click on the folder *F15A (Fri) Clarissa Tatang + Shrey Somaiya*.
4. Click on the session for that week. Starting from 2:30pm, the week's session will be highlighted in bold.
- If you ever want to access tutorial notes or examples, I will upload them at this link: https://github.com/CurePeach/comp1511-20t3-f15a
- Also, it is okay if you have no prior coding knowledge! We don't expect you guys to have prior coding knowledge.

Here are some important tasks!
- Try set up home computing! You can find written walkthroughs and video tutorials on the *Home Computing* page on WebCMS3. I recommend using TigerVNC, and if you are experiencing issues with this method, feel free to talk to us about it. During the first week, our priority is to set up your ability to work with C and Linux so don't be afraid.
- Make sure you have access to the course forum! Our course forum is hosted on Discourse and can be easily accessed from the *Course Forum (Discourse)* link on WebCMS3. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to ask us.
