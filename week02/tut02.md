3. What is a constant? What makes it different to a variable? How do we use them?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  A constant is a value that cannot be changed while variables can be easily changed. The way constants work is it similar to a find and replace.
  
  To create one, we use the following syntax:

```
#define CONSTANT_NAME constant_value
```

  Notice there is no semi-colons and no equal signs.

  Now, when we compile the code, the compiler will replace every instance of CONSTANT_NAME with constant_value, and then convert it to machine code.
