# Assignment 2 Notes

Just like assignment 1, it is split into five stages - the first one being the easiest and the fifth one being the most difficult.

Recommended steps:
1. Read everything from start to end.
2. Focus on the first stage.
3. Write tests for the first stage.
4. Make sure everything works for the first stage.
5. Repeat steps 2-3 with as many stages as you want.

**Make sure your code works for previous stages before moving on to next stages. Especially in this assignment because your next stages' code does rely on previous stages' code.**

Tips:
- Don't look at any .c files but the c files you can change (cspotify.c and test_cspotify.c).
- Definitely look at the .h files. The .h files are everything you need.
- To open multiple files, you can use the *. Eg. "gedit *.c &" opens all the .c files in your current directory.
